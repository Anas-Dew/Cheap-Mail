# Cheap-Mail
Cheapest way to send a mail ever ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚

To send mail from this app you should turn on "LESS SECURE APPS" from your google account.

# Main Feature
Send mail from a gmail account, its super simple just remember your password ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚

# Frustating things 

* You can't send a mail with an account which is protected with Two-Factor Auth. S*it
* LESS SECURE APPS should be turned on !!!
* Any slight mistake will make app crash and you have to start over ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚
